Work together to answer these questions.  

All the information you need should be in the OHI Methods [document](https://raw.githack.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/published/documents/methods/Supplement.html#2_the_theory_of_ohi).

I will be around to answer any questions...so don't hesitate to get clarification, extra guidance, or request hints!

### OHI score models and data
1. What is the difference between a goal's "status" and "score"?

The status of a goal refers to the current state relative to the reference point. There is also a future status which is made up of three subdimensions, resilience, pressure, and trend. These three areas area projected five years in the future to predict the status at that point. The score is the average of the status scores. 

<br>
<br>

2. If a region's food provision goal has the following values, what would its food provision score be?

Predicted future status: 80

Current status: 60

The food provision score would be 70.

<br>
<br>

3. Given the following data, what would this region's Index score be?

Goal/subgoal  | Abbreviation   | Score
------------- | -------------- | -------------
Artisanal Fishing Opportunity | AO | 90
Habitat | HAB | 50
Species Condition | SPP | 30
Carbon Storage | CS | 20
Clean Waters | CW | 95
Coastal Livelihoods and Economies | LE | 60
Coastal Protection | CP | 80
Food Provision | FP | 85
Natural Products | NP | 100
Sense of Place | SP | 10
Tourism and Recreation | TR | 50


NOTE: The abbreviations for subgoals have 3 letters and goals have 2 letters.

```{r}
(90 + (50 + 30)/2 + 20 + 95 + 60 + 80 + 85 + 100 + 10 + 50)/10
```
<br>
<br>

4. Fill in the missing values.  

NOTE: Pressure and resilience must be multiplied by 0.01.  Trend and status are not modified. 


Dimension | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2
---------- | ---------- | ---------
Score      |    71.25   | 77.5
Current status |  75 | 75
Predicted future status | 67.5 |  80
Trend | 0.10 | 0.10
Pressure | 100 | 50
Resilience | 50 | 50

```{r}
current <- 75
pred_future_2 <- 80
score_2 <- (current + pred_future_2)/2

trend <- .1
pressure <- 100 * .01
resilience <- 50 * .01
beta <- 2/3

pred_future_1 <- ((1 + beta * trend) + ((1 - beta) * (resilience - pressure))) * current 
score_1 <- (current + pred_future_1)/2

diff <- score_2 - score_1
```

QUESTION: How did a pressure change from 100 to 50 affect the final score?  Was this a larger or smaller effect than you would have expected?

A pressure change from 100 to 50 increased the predicted future status by 5 points from it's current status which increased the total score by 2.5 points. This is a smaller effect than I would expect for the overall score, but it seems to increase the predicted future status as I would expect.

### Humans as part of the ecosystem
<br>
5. To calculate the Fishery subgoal, we:

a. Obtain B/Bmsy  scores for each stock that is harvested.   B/Bmsy is defined as: the ratio of observed biomass to the biomass that would provide maximum sustainable yield. When B/BMSY = 1, then biomass equals BMSY. If B/BMSY falls below 1, biomass is too low to provide maximum sustainable yield. For example, if B/BMSY = 0.5, then biomass is only 50% of that needed for maximum sustainable yield. (from: http://www.catchshareindicators.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/NE_Biomass_Feb-2014.pdf)

b. Convert B/Bmsy into a stock status score that ranges from 0-1, with one reflecting a perfect score.  The relationship between B/Bmsy values and stock status scores looks like this:

![](figures/fis_methods.png)

c. Take some sort of average of the stock status scores within each region (for the global we use a geometric mean weighted by catch).

QUESTION: B/Bmsy scores greater than 1 indicate the stock is doing well, but is underharvested!  Given this, do you think we should penalize underharvesting? Why? Do you have any ideas for how we could account for underharvesting without unduly penalizing regions that are trying to let stocks recover? 

I think this is a complicated topic and is very hard to answer. For example, the squid fishery in California is seen as a sustainable fishery, yet the only reason it is "sustainable" is because we have all but eliminated their predators. Should we value only what we currently fish? Or should we stop fishing squid until seabass, dolphin, and sea lion populations increase sufficiently to eat the excess. Penalizing the country score is in my opinion too human centric and too focused on immediate uses. I think it fails to take into consideration the potential future increase in stocks that may increase the Bmsy and allow future humans to increase fishing effort in order to feed more people. Why not account for population increase? Why not value increased stocks? Perhaps humans in certain areas value tourism spawned from increased fishery stocks.

### Gapfilling
6. Imagine you are calculating OHI scores for 10 regions.  The data you can find for an economic variable that is used to calculate the status of one of the goals looks like this:

rgn_id   | data
-------- | -------
1        | 72
2        | 74
3        | 80
4        | 70
5        | NA
6        | NA
7        | 71
8        | 75
9        | 76
10       | 76

QUESTION: Should the missing values (NA is a missing value in R) remain missing?  If so, why?

Or, should you try to estimate the missing values?  If so, how might you go about estimating them?

I think that the missing values should be evaluated for the potential to fill them. I think it could make sense to impute values through several methods depending on the goal we are evaluating and the amount of available data. For instance, a regional mean would make sense if there are several regions with similar ecological and spatial attributes. Other dataset that might be spatial rasters could use something like Krieging to interpolate missing values. I can also see a case being made for certain goals to fill missing values with 0 if you were able to make assumptions about the region in question, like an uninhabited island getting a 0 filled for mariculture or fishing.

7. Read the methods section for the Lasting Special Places subgoal: https://ohi-science.org/ohiprep_v2021/Reference/methods_and_results/Supplement.html#692_Lasting_special_places_(subgoal_of_sense_of_place)

The information in this section describes how status and trend are calculated for this goal, it also includes the data used to calculate the pressure and resilience dimensions.

QUESTION: What is the reference point for this subgoal?

30%

Explore the links to the pressures and resilience data layers.

Follow this link to the functions.R file in ohi-global: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/functions.R

Find the Lasting Special Places function.  See if you can reconcile the model described in the Methods with the code. (NOTE: Just aim for a large picture overview...at this point you do not need to understand every step….or even most of this)

8. The trend for the Tourism and Recreation goal for the United States is -0.15.  Describe what this means.

This means that Tourism and Recreation is projected to be reduced by 15% in five years and either tourism is decreasing, sustainability is decreasing, or possibly both.

<br>
<br>

9. We are going to walk through a trend calculation.  If R is installed on your computer, follow along.

Status data for a region's Tourism and Recreation goal:

Year  | Status
------ | ----------
2010  | 72
2011  | 71
2012  | 72
2013  | 73
2014  | 77
2015  | 80
2016  | 82

*STEP 1* Estimate the average change per year using a linear regression model

![](figures/trend_lm.jpg)

The 0.027 value is the slope estimate, which is the average change in status per year estimated by the linear model.

*STEP 2* Obtain proportional change by dividing the slope estimate by the earliest status value used in the linear model:

`0.027/0.72 = 0.0375`

There has been nearly a 4% increase in status per year.

*STEP 3* The goal is to predict the change in 5 years, so we multiply the yearly proportional change by 5:

`0.0375 * 5 = 0.1875`

Status is predicted to increase about 19% in 5 years.

In 2021, status is predicted to be (ignoring pressure/resilience dimensions):
82 * (1 + 0.1875) = 97

QUESTION: What assumptions are we making by using this formulation of trend to calculate the likely future status?

We are assuming that the trend is linear which may not be the case. There could have been recent changes that improved the score temporarily but those changes could be temporary or possibly reversed in the near future. This also assumes that resilience is equal to pressure, which could change rapidly. 

QUESTION: Can you think of any scenarios when we would not use 5 years of data to estimate trend?

Certain goals may lack enough recent data.

### Goal pressure and resilience
<br>

10. The pressure dimension plays a relatively small role in goal scores (see figure 4.1), but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data!

The final pressure dimension is calculated for each region and goal using a function from the ohicore package.  The function requires several pieces of information:

a. A data layer for each pressure layer describing the magnitude of the pressure on a scale of 0-1.  For example, here is the sea surface temperature pressure layer (low pressures are good and high pressures are bad): https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2022/blob/gh-pages/globalprep/prs_sst/v2021/output/sst_updated.csv

b. Classifying the pressure category for each data layer. The pressure dimension is based on two types of pressures: Ecological and Social (Figure 4.2).  The ecological pressures are broken into 5 categories (pollution, alien species, habitat destruction, fishing, and climate change).  Each pressure data layer is assigned to a category in this file: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/pressure_categories.csv

QUESTION: How many climate change pressures are there? 

There are 4 climate change pressures.

c. Pressure x goal weighting. Pressures have little or no effect on some goals, but huge effects on others.  The relationship between the goals and the pressure variables is described here: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv

QUESTION: Which pressure layers affect the FIS subgoal?  How many regulatory pressure layers are there?  How many social layers are there?  Which is more important: Ecological or Social pressures? 

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv")
df %>% filter(goal == "FIS") %>% 
  select(where(~!any(is.na(.)))) %>% 
  select(-goal) %>% 
  names()
```
 
There are two social layers, weakness of governance and weakness of social progress. I am not sure how to determine which layers are regulatory. The ecological and social pressures are equally important. 

QUESTION: Some goals, like Coastal Protection, have multiple “elements”.  Why? 

Some goals have multiple elements due to subcategories like different multiple habitat types. This helps to ensure every goal can be applied to every region. 

NOTE: It is convention to add a superscript to the pressure name that describes its category:
* po=pollution
* hd=habitat destruction
* sp=alien species
* fp=fishing pressure
* cc=climate change
* ss=social  

<br>
<br>

11.  Similar to the pressures dimension, resilience plays a relatively small role in goal scores (see figure 4.1) but still takes a lot of effort.

The final pressure dimension is calculated for each region and goal using a function from the ohicore package.  The function requires several pieces of information:

a. A data layer for each pressure layer describing the magnitude of the pressure on a scale of 0-1. For example, here is the Social Progress Index layer (low resilience is bad and high resilience is good): https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2022/blob/gh-pages/globalprep/prs_res_spi/v2021/output/spi_res.csv

b. The resilience dimension includes two major categories: Ecological and Social (Figure 4.3). Ecological resilience has two subcategories: Ecosystem and Regulatory.  Regulatory is comprised of the same 5 subcomponents as the Ecological *pressures*: pollution, alien species, habitat destruction, fishing, and climate change.  There is also a “goal” specific subcomponent.   Each resilience data layer is assigned to a category in this file: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/resilience_categories.csv

c. The relationship between goals and resilience is described here: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/resilience_matrix.csv
