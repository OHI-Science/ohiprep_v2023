Work together to answer these questions.  

All the information you need should be in the OHI Methods [document](https://raw.githack.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/published/documents/methods/Supplement.html#2_the_theory_of_ohi).

I will be around to answer any questions...so don't hesitate to get clarification, extra guidance, or request hints!

### OHI score models and data
1. What is the difference between a goal's "status" and "score"?

**`Status` refers to the goal's current status and `score` is the average of the goal's `status` (current status) and `future` (predicted future status).**

2. If a region's food provision goal has the following values, what would its food provision score be?

Predicted future status: 80

Current status: 60

**The region's food provision goal in this instance would be 70.**

3. Given the following data, what would this region's Index score be?

Goal/subgoal  | Abbreviation   | Score
------------- | -------------- | -------------
Artisanal Fishing Opportunity | AO | 90
Habitat | HAB | 50
Species Condition | SPP | 30
Carbon Storage | CS | 20
Clean Waters | CW | 95
Coastal Livelihoods and Economies | LE | 60
Coastal Protection | CP | 80
Food Provision | FP | 85
Natural Products | NP | 100
Sense of Place | SP | 10
Tourism and Recreation | TR | 50


NOTE: The abbreviations for subgoals have 3 letters and goals have 2 letters.

```{r}
BD <- (50 + 30) / 2 

(90 + BD + 20 + 95 + 60 + 80 + 85 + 100 + 10 + 50) / 10
```


**This regions index score would be 63**

4. Fill in the missing values.  

NOTE: Pressure and resilience must be multiplied by 0.01.  Trend and status are not modified. 


Dimension               | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2
----------------------- | ---------- | ---------
Score                   | 71.25      | 77.5
Current status          | 75         | 75
Predicted future status | 67.5       | 80
Trend                   | 0.10       | 0.10
Pressure                | 100        | 50
Resilience              | 50         | 50


```{r}
res <- 50
pres <- 100
trend <- 0.1

pres_diff <- (res - pres) * .01

scen_future <- (1 + (pres_diff * 1/3) + (trend * 2/3)) * 75
scen_future
```



QUESTION: How did a pressure change from 100 to 50 affect the final score?  Was this a larger or smaller effect than you would have expected?

**It decreased the final score quite a bit, although that's about on par with what I would expect with such high pressure.**


### Humans as part of the ecosystem

5. To calculate the Fishery subgoal, we:

a. Obtain B/Bmsy  scores for each stock that is harvested.   B/Bmsy is defined as: the ratio of observed biomass to the biomass that would provide maximum sustainable yield. When B/BMSY = 1, then biomass equals BMSY. If B/BMSY falls below 1, biomass is too low to provide maximum sustainable yield. For example, if B/BMSY = 0.5, then biomass is only 50% of that needed for maximum sustainable yield. (from: http://www.catchshareindicators.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/NE_Biomass_Feb-2014.pdf)

b. Convert B/Bmsy into a stock status score that ranges from 0-1, with one reflecting a perfect score.  The relationship between B/Bmsy values and stock status scores looks like this:

![](figures/fis_methods.png)

c. Take some sort of average of the stock status scores within each region (for the global we use a geometric mean weighted by catch).

QUESTION: B/Bmsy scores greater than 1 indicate the stock is doing well, but is underharvested!  Given this, do you think we should penalize underharvesting? Why? Do you have any ideas for how we could account for underharvesting without unduly penalizing regions that are trying to let stocks recover? 

**It makes sense to penalize underharvesting *if* there is an overall lack of food in the country---more specifically, if there is hunger associated with a true lack of food and not, for example, a situation like in the US where there is an abundance of food but our food system and general inequality create a lot of hunger. This would make calculating the score highly nuanced, though. In terms of accounting for stock recovery, perhaps data could be collected on whether or not regions are letting stocks recover and that could be factored into the score.**

### Gapfilling
6. Imagine you are calculating OHI scores for 10 regions.  The data you can find for an economic variable that is used to calculate the status of one of the goals looks like this:

rgn_id   | data
-------- | -------
1        | 72
2        | 74
3        | 80
4        | 70
5        | NA
6        | NA
7        | 71
8        | 75
9        | 76
10       | 76

QUESTION: Should the missing values (NA is a missing value in R) remain missing?  If so, why?

Or, should you try to estimate the missing values?  If so, how might you go about estimating them?
<br>
**I think this would depend on the goal and what data are available. If regions with missing values are surrounded by comparable regions that do have data, then it would likely make sense to interpolate in some way, or if the score is one that could be reliably estimated using other available data then a regression or other model could be used. Values could be estimates via regional means, some form of spatial interpolation, or estimated using known characteristics of the region.**

7. Read the methods section for the Lasting Special Places subgoal: https://ohi-science.org/ohiprep_v2021/Reference/methods_and_results/Supplement.html#692_Lasting_special_places_(subgoal_of_sense_of_place)

The information in this section describes how status and trend are calculated for this goal, it also includes the data used to calculate the pressure and resilience dimensions.

QUESTION: What is the reference point for this subgoal?

**The reference point for Lasting Special Places is 30% of coastal area protected.**

Explore the links to the pressures and resilience data layers.

Follow this link to the functions.R file in ohi-global: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/functions.R

Find the Lasting Special Places function.  See if you can reconcile the model described in the Methods with the code. (NOTE: Just aim for a large picture overview...at this point you do not need to understand every step….or even most of this)

8. The trend for the Tourism and Recreation goal for the United States is -0.15.  Describe what this means.

**This means that the TR goal score for the US is predicted to be 15% lower than it's current score in five years. The trend is calculated using linear regression based on scores from the previous five years---the slope is divided by the earliest score value to arrive at the proportional trend.**

9. We are going to walk through a trend calculation.  If R is installed on your computer, follow along.

Status data for a region's Tourism and Recreation goal:

Year  | Status
----- | ----------
2010  | 72
2011  | 71
2012  | 72
2013  | 73
2014  | 77
2015  | 80
2016  | 82

*STEP 1* Estimate the average change per year using a linear regression model

![](figures/trend_lm.jpg)

The 0.027 value is the slope estimate, which is the average change in status per year estimated by the linear model.


*STEP 2* Obtain proportional change by dividing the slope estimate by the earliest status value used in the linear model:

`0.027/0.72 = 0.0375`

There has been nearly a 4% increase in status per year.

*STEP 3* The goal is to predict the change in 5 years, so we multiply the yearly proportional change by 5:

`0.0375 * 5 = 0.1875`

Status is predicted to increase about 19% in 5 years.

In 2021, status is predicted to be (ignoring pressure/resilience dimensions):
82 * (1 + 0.1875) = 97

QUESTION: What assumptions are we making by using this formulation of trend to calculate the likely future status?

**We are assuming that the trend is linear. We are assuming the absence of acute future events that might have a large impact on score.**

QUESTION: Can you think of any scenarios when we would not use 5 years of data to estimate trend?

**If the trend in the previous five years was clearly nonlinear or non-monotonic. If all five years of data were not available or reliable.**


### Goal pressure and resilience
<br>

10. The pressure dimension plays a relatively small role in goal scores (see figure 4.1), but it takes a lot of effort to prepare the data!

The final pressure dimension is calculated for each region and goal using a function from the ohicore package.  The function requires several pieces of information:

a. A data layer for each pressure layer describing the magnitude of the pressure on a scale of 0-1.  For example, here is the sea surface temperature pressure layer (low pressures are good and high pressures are bad): https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2022/blob/gh-pages/globalprep/prs_sst/v2021/output/sst_updated.csv

b. Classifying the pressure category for each data layer. The pressure dimension is based on two types of pressures: Ecological and Social (Figure 4.2).  The ecological pressures are broken into 5 categories (pollution, alien species, habitat destruction, fishing, and climate change).  Each pressure data layer is assigned to a category in this file: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/pressure_categories.csv

QUESTION: How many climate change pressures are there? 

```{r}
pressure_categories <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/eez/conf/pressure_categories.csv")
```

**4 climate change pressures**

c. Pressure x goal weighting. Pressures have little or no effect on some goals, but huge effects on others.  The relationship between the goals and the pressure variables is described here: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv

QUESTION: Which pressure layers affect the FIS subgoal?

```{r}
pressures_matrix <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/eez/conf/pressures_matrix.csv")

fis_pressures_df <- pressures_matrix %>% 
  filter(goal == "FIS" )

fis_pressure_layers <- fis_pressures_df[, !is.na(fis_pressures_df)] %>% 
  select(-c("goal", "element", "element_name")) %>% 
  names()
```

**The following pressure layers affect the FIS subgoal: `r fis_pressure_layers`**

How many regulatory pressure layers are there?

```{r}
pressures_matrix %>% 
  select(-c("goal", "element", "element_name")) %>% 
  ncol()
```

**I was unable to find where the designation "regulatory pressure layers" was defined.**

How many social layers are there?

```{r}
pressures_matrix[, stringr::str_detect(names(pressures_matrix), "ss_")] %>% 
  names()
```

**There are two social pressures layers: "Weakness of governance" and "Weakness of social progress".**

Which is more important: Ecological or Social pressures? 

**Social and ecological pressures are of equal importance.**


QUESTION: Some goals, like Coastal Protection, have multiple “elements”.  Why? 

**Different pressures affect different habitats that are factored into the coastal protection score.**

NOTE: It is convention to add a superscript to the pressure name that describes its category:
* po=pollution
* hd=habitat destruction
* sp=alien species
* fp=fishing pressure
* cc=climate change

<br>
<br>

11.  Similar to the pressures dimension, resilience plays a relatively small role in goal scores (see figure 4.1) but still takes a lot of effort.

The final pressure dimension is calculated for each region and goal using a function from the ohicore package.  The function requires several pieces of information:

a. A data layer for each pressure layer describing the magnitude of the pressure on a scale of 0-1. For example, here is the Social Progress Index layer (low resilience is bad and high resilience is good): https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2022/blob/gh-pages/globalprep/prs_res_spi/v2021/output/spi_res.csv

b. The resilience dimension includes two major categories: Ecological and Social (Figure 4.3). Ecological resilience has two subcategories: Ecosystem and Regulatory.  Regulatory is comprised of the same 5 subcomponents as the Ecological *pressures*: pollution, alien species, habitat destruction, fishing, and climate change.  There is also a “goal” specific subcomponent.   Each resilience data layer is assigned to a category in this file: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/resilience_categories.csv

c. The relationship between goals and resilience is described here: https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/eez/conf/resilience_matrix.csv
